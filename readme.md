I get a lot of questions by email. This way anyone can read the answer!

Anything means *almost anything*. Preferably questions that others could find beneficial to read the answers of  :)
The more specific you are with your request, the more likely you are to receive a helpful answer. I don't respond to requests to "chat".

**I'm unable to provide technical support or help debug your code, so I won't be able to tell you how to**
- **Use some of my open source code in your Wordpress Site**
- **Help complete your homework assignment**
